Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

This repository contains code for predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The code reads historical stock data from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, trains an LSTM model, and generates predictions for future stock prices.

Introduction
Stock price prediction is a challenging task in the field of financial forecasting. Accurate prediction of stock prices can provide valuable insights for investors and traders, helping them make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding stocks. This project aims to develop a machine learning model using LSTM networks to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
•	Python 3.x
•	Pandas
•	Matplotlib
•	NumPy
•	TensorFlow
•	Keras

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

File Descriptions
•	stock_prediction.py: Python script for reading, preprocessing, training, and predicting stock prices using LSTM networks.

•	MSFT.csv: Sample CSV file containing historical stock data (replace with your own dataset).

Results:
The trained LSTM model generates predictions for future stock prices. Visualizations of the predicted prices compared to actual observations are provided for the training, validation, and test sets.
